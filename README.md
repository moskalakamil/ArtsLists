# Art Gallery App
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Overview
This React Native application serves as an interactive platform for art enthusiasts to explore and appreciate a curated collection of artworks. Users can browse through a list of gathered masterpieces, delve into detailed information about each artwork, and learn more about the talented artists behind them. The app also provides features for liking artworks and offers a search functionality for easy navigation.

## Features
- Artwork List: View a comprehensive list of artworks, each displaying key details.
- Artwork Details: Access in-depth information about each artwork, including title, artist, and additional details.
- Artist Information: Explore details about the creators of the artworks showcased in the app.
- Like Functionality: Express appreciation for favorite artworks by liking them.
- Search Capability: Easily find specific artworks using the search feature.
## API Integration
The application utilizes the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs) to fetch data about artworks and artists. This seamless integration enhances the app's content with rich and authoritative information.

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

### Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run your React Native App. :partying_face:

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
